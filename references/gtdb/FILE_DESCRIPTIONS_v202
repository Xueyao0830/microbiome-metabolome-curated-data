Files provided with GTDB R05-RS95. Analogous files are provide for Archaea. Both
compress and uncompressed files are available in some cases for convenience.

* METHODS
    Overview of methods used to form the GTDB taxonomy.

* RELEASE_NOTES
    Overview of changes specific to this release of the GTDB.

* VERSION
    Version identifier for this release of the GTDB.

* bac120_taxonomy_<release>.tsv
    GTDB taxonomy for all bacterial genomes assigned to a GTDB species cluster.

* bac120_<release>.tree
    Bacterial reference tree inferred from the concatenation of 120 proteins and spanning the representative
    genomes for each bacterial species cluster. This tree is used to curate the GTDB taxonomy. The provided
    tree is in Newick format, decorated with the GTDB taxonomy, and contains non-parametric bootstrap support
    values.

* bac120_metadata_<release>.tar.gz
    Metadata for all bacterial genomes including GTDB and NCBI taxonomies, completeness and
    contamination estimates, assembly statistics, and genomic properties.


* Files in genomic_files_reps are specific to GTDB species representatives:
    * bac120_marker_genes_reps_<release>.tar.gz
        Untrimmed and unaligned marker genes used in the concatenated alignment used to infer
        the bacterial reference tree. Genomes without a marker gene indicate either multiple hits or 
        no hits were found for that gene. Genes are provided as both nucleotide and amino acid
        sequences. Trimmed and aligned hits can be found in bac120_msa_marker_genes_reps_<release>.tar.gz.

    * bac120_msa_marker_genes_reps_<release>.tar.gz
        Trimmed and aligned marker genes for GTDB representative for each of the 120 bacterial proteins.
        
    * bac120_msa_reps_<release>.tar.gz
        Multiple sequence alignment used to infer the bacterial reference tree.

    * bac120_ssu_reps_<release>.tar.gz
        FASTA file of 16S rRNA gene sequences identified within the set of bacterial representative genomes. The longest 
        identified 16S rRNA sequence is selected for each representative genomes. The assigned taxonomy reflects the 
        GTDB classification of the genome. Sequences are identified using nhmmer with the 16S rRNA model (RF00177) from the 
        RFAM database. Only sequences with a length >=200 bp and an E-value <= 1e-06 are reported. In a small number of cases, 
        the 16S rRNA sequences are incongruent with this taxonomic assignment as a result of contaminating 16S rRNA sequences.

    * gtdb_proteins_aa_reps_<release>.tar.gz
        Amino acid FASTA files for all protein-coding gene sequences predicted with Prodigal.
        
    * gtdb_proteins_nt_reps_<release>.tar.gz
        Nucleotide FASTA files for all protein-coding gene sequences predicted with Prodigal.
        
    * gtdb_genomes_reps_<release>.tar.gz
        FASTA files for each GTDB representative genome.


* Files in genomic_files_all cover all genomes passing the QC criteria of the GTDB:
    * bac120_marker_genes_all_<release>.tar.gz
        Untrimmed and unaligned marker genes for all GTDB genomes. Genomes without a marker gene indicate 
        either multiple hits or no hits were found for that gene. Genes are provided as both nucleotide 
        and amino acidsequences. Trimmed and aligned hits can be found in bac120_msa_marker_genes_all_<release>.tar.gz.
        
    * bac120_msa_marker_genes_all_<release>.tar.gz
        Trimmed and aligned marker genes for all GTDB genomes for each of the 120 bacterial proteins.
        
    * ssu_all_<release>.tar.gz
        FASTA file containing 16S rRNA sequences identified across the set of GTDB genomes passing QC. The assigned taxonomy 
        reflects the GTDB classification of the genome. Sequences are identified using nhmmer with the 16S rRNA model (RF00177) 
        from the RFAM database. All sequences with a length >=200 bp and an E-value <= 1e-06 are reported.

* Files in auxillary_files:
    * bac120_<release>.sp_labels.tree
        Synonymous to the bac120_<release>.tree, except with species labels appended to each genome.
    
    * bac120_msa_mask_<release>.txt
        Mask indicating which columns were trimmed from the 120 bacterial protein concatenated alignment. 

    * bac120_marker_info_<release>.tsv
        Information about each of the 120 bacterial proteins used to infer the bacterial reference tree. 
        The order of proteins in this file indicates the order in which they are concatenated in the MSA.
  
    * gtdb_<release>.dic
        List of all taxa with and without rank prefixes in GTDB. This can be used as a dictionary in word
        processing programs to indicate the correct spelling of GTDB taxa. See:

        genomes according to the GTDB. This includes the genomic FASTA files for the GTDB reference genomes.

    * hq_mimag_genomes_<release>.tsv

         - presence of the 5S, 16S, and 23S rRNA genes with a minimum length of 80 bp for 5S,
